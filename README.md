# TokoRadioMenu
A really easy to use menu for TokoVoip radio.

So yeah, I discovered the was no builtin way to use radios on TokoVoip. 
And TokoRadioSwitch wasn't what I was looking for because it requires ESX.
So I decided to create a custom system for this, that was easy to use.
~It uses [NativeUILua-Reloaded](https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua_Reloaded) for the menu.~ It now uses the old deprecated [NativeUILua](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua) because I can't get the reloaded working.

## Quickstart
Download one of the releases via [here](https://github.com/GameMaster2030/TokoRadioMenu/releases) and download NativeUI via [here](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua/releases). 
Then put both into the resource folder and add to the server.cfg: 
```
start NativeUI
start TokoRadioMenu
```
To open the menu, press `B` in game.
