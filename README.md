# TokoRadioMenu
A really easy to use menu for TokoVoip radio.

So yeah, I discovered the was no builtin way to use radios on TokoVoip. 
And TokoRadioSwitch wasn't what I was looking for because it requires ESX.
So I decided to create a custom system for this, that was easy to use.
It uses [NativeUILua-Reloaded](https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua_Reloaded) for the menu.

## Quickstart
Download one of the releases via [here](https://github.com/GameMaster2030/TokoRadioMenu/releases). 
Then put it into the resource folder and add to the server.cfg: `start TokoRadioMenu`.

## Configuring and more
